 <h1> Welcome</h1>
  <p>Thank you for visiting The Digital Yoga Studies Repository!</p>
 <p>In this repository, you will find a variety of resources for yoga enthusiasts and researchers.
  This includes and is not limited to yoga sequences, images of poses both of humans and drawings, class plans, feedback and assessment forms, geospatial maps, literature and technology resources all for anyone's use. 
Nothing in this repository claims to be perfect or complete, as we remain a student of the yoga practice and your commentary is quite welcome. All that we ask is that this work is used with respect to where yoga comes from.
  The goal of yoga is to find an easy seat for meditation, so while we collaborate and share - let us honor the traditions that which these ideas originate - our teachers.
Thank you for visiting!
