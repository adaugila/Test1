 <h1> Welcome</h1>
  <p>Thank you for visiting The Digital Yoga Studies Repository!</p>
 <p>In this repo, you will find a variety of sequences, images of poses both real and drawing, class plans, feedback and assessment forms, maps, literature and technology resources all for your use.
Nothing in this repository claims to ever be perfect or complete, as we remain a student of the yoga practice and your commentary is quite welcome.
  
  The goal of yoga is to find an easy seat for meditation, so while we collaborate and share - let us honor the traditions that which these ideas originate.
