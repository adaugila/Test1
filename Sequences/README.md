<h1> Welcome to Sequences! </h1>
<b><p> Objective:</b> The idea here is to use the provided sequences as a 'breath cue' or 'time cue' based template as inspiration to create your own vinyasa sequence. From there, it is up to you. I suggest that you work with your own teacher or with me, using GitHub to collaborate on your own 'yoga code' via pull requests. I hope that you will find it's exactly what yogis needed to take their sequence collaboration to the next level in an anarchist way.</p>
<p> Learn how to use GitHub by navigating to their docs section.</p>
