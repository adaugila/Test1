<h1> Welcome to Sequences! </h1>
<b><p> Objective:</b> The idea here is to use the provided sequence as a 'breath cue' based template as inspiration to create your own vinyasa sequence. From there, it is up to you. I suggest that you  work with your own teacher or with me, using github to collaborate on your own 'yoga code' via pull requests. I hope that you will find it's exactly what yogis needed to take their sequence collaboration to the next level.</p>
