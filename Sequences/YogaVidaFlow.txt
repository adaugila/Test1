Duration: 65 minutes
Sanskrit | English

Surya Namaskar | Sun Salutations 
Objective: Using from what I understand to be the Traditional Vinyasa Flow; Sun Salutations will mostly have such a standard vinyasa flow in between a large sequence of postures and will always be in sync on the inhalations and exhalations of the breath. The first two examples are Vinyasa flows with Warrior 1 and 2 [Virabhadrasana A/B] variations ending in Dandasana. Let the following be an example of how I’d teach a flow and also how I’ve tied my class together in a similar style of Vinyasa for YV:

Start in Samasthiti Feet are together at front of the mat; gaze is forward
IN: Lift arms up over head and meet palms together; Gaze toward thumbs
EX: Fold forward into Uttanasana | Standing Forward Bend; fingertips meet the mat, inline with feet; Gaze is at the tip of the nose
IN: Lift the chest and gaze forward
EX: Hop the feet back and lower into Chaturunga | Four-Limbed Staff Pose
IN: Straighten the arms and draw the chest forward, rolling the toes over until the feet point away from you into Urdhva Mukka Svanasana | Upward Dog; Gaze forward
EX: Roll toes under and lift buttocks into Addo Mukka Svanasana | Downward Dog;  Gaze toward the navel; At the end of the exhale, bend knees and gaze forward in preparation for next movement
